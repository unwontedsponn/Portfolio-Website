<!-- TO DO -->
Adding a shopping cart. When someone clicks on add book to cart, I want the shopping cart to have a number 1 next to it, and 2 if they click twice... This is the aim at least.

Tailwind correct class order:
Layout > Flexbox & Grid > Positioning > Spacing > Sizing > Typography > Backgrounds > Borders > Effects > Transforms > Interactivity.

Check for ESLint errors in the terminal
npm run lint
