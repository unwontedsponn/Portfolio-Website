As a composer who is interested in making sound and music for experiences that support people’s wellbeing, I agree wholeheartedly with this statement and want to gain more insight into ways that music can impact peoples’ physiology and behaviour. There is growing demand for games and apps that help people to manage the stress of daily life, such as Endel, an app backed by neuroscientists which creates ‘personalised soundscapes to help you focus, relax, and sleep’ (Endel, 2021). I have used this post to gain more understanding into the relationship between sound and wellbeing.

# Sound Healing
The concept of music therapy originates from the 1940’s, when the United States military ‘incorporated music into their programmes for the recuperation of army personnel during World War II’.(Yugay, 2019). A broader notion of healing through sound however, dates all the way back to ancient Greece, when physicians used musical instruments to treat digestive issues, insomnia and emotional upset.

The award winning British Academy of Sound Therapy writes that it is now ‘widely accepted that most illnesses are stress related ‘ (What Is Sound Therapy? 2014). Therefore the majority of their healing comes from relaxation and stress reduction to prevent and treat illness. It is no surprise that in addition to their therapy practices one of their team, Lyz Cooper, composes bespoke therapeutic music by drawing on the latest research in cognitive neuroscience and music psychology. In 2011 she collaborated with the ambient group Marconi Union and created the ‘world’s most relaxing song’(Conner, 2019). The piece is titled ‘Weightless’ and is apparently so effective that it is considered dangerous to play while driving. In her own words Lyz says that her music has ‘extra sonic vitamins added’(Consciously Designed Music, 2014) and that each piece is designed to reduce stress, anxiety and heart attacks.

So how does music do this? The answer is through a process called respiratory entrainment.

# Music impacts our physiology through respiratory entrainment
In 1920 Charles M Diserens explained that music affects the timing of our breathing; in his words, our ‘respiratory rhythm follows that of the music’ (Larsen and Galletly, 2006). I noticed this when I recently played the puzzle game Superliminal. It has a slow, ever evolving jazz piano soundtrack by Matt Christensen, which put me in an almost hypnotic state as I completed various optical illusion tasks within the game. My breathing became slower and fell much more in sync with the music, and this in turn helped me to relax and feel more calm.

In the article ‘Il flauto magico still works: Mozart’s secret of ventilation’ (2013), Professor Klaus Laczika and his colleagues note how the reverse is also true. Just as music shapes our breathing, our breathing is also what shapes certain aspects of music in the first place, such as musical phrasing. ‘Music is breathing: phrasing is nothing other than a “mirror” of the lung’s activity.’ When I think of music through this lens, as a creation that has come from the human body, it becomes even more obvious that music has the power to change our physical experience. During a performance of W.A. Mozart’s Piano Concerto KV 449, healthy professional musicians and members of the audience were studied to understand the effect of sound on the body. This was done by capturing participants’ heart and breath rate during the concerto. Next this data was overlaid onto the musical score of the concerto, which led to the observation that there was ‘synchronisation and regulation between performers, audience and the musical structure.’(Laczika, 2013). The following image shows how the breathing of three audience members became more synchronised across a six bar section. The study concludes that musical structure is a powerful force that is able to unify both performer and listener with the music itself.

*Laczika, K. et. al, 2013*

Tempo, rhythm and musical structure all have a direct affect on our breathing. Music can be created with the specific intention to help the listener to de-stress and feel good. Is it possible for music to negatively impact listeners though?

# Music can impair decision making
In recent years, studies have revealed that music can have an effect on shoppers’ arousal, pleasure and shopping behaviour. A study conducted in a Virtual Reality store, in the online virtual world Second Life, confirmed that using music that induced positive emotional states in shoppers made them more likely to ‘perceive an activity [i.e. shopping] as having high benefits and low risks’ (Cheery, 2020). The mental shortcut that occurs when making decisions quickly based on emotion is called the Affect Heuristic, and while in some scenarios quick decision making is a benefit, being too easily led by your emotions can leave you open to manipulation — like purchasing things you might later regret.

# Conclusion
It is clear that sound and music is a powerful tool that can be used to enhance wellbeing, but also to manipulate our behaviour. My vision for an upcoming project is to design sound and music to accompany an experience that promotes the positive aspects of escapism, like rest and creativity. For this reason it has been valuable for me to gain more insight into the kinds of music that support relaxation, and how I might create it myself further down the line.
