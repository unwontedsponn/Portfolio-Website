# The basics of diegetic, non-diegetic and trans-diegetic sound.
To define trans-diegetic sound we first need to understand diegetic and non-diegetic sound. **Diegetic** sounds are those occurring *within* a storyworld, inside of it, for instance the sound an on-screen character makes when putting on his coat, or the music played through the speakers of that character’s car. **Non-diegetic** refers to any sound that is heard *outside* of the storyworld, sound that the characters cannot hear, such as triumphant, celebratory music accompanying a victorious moment in the narrative. Its purpose is to stir and intensify emotion in the viewer. Even when non-diegetic sound *juxtaposes* the action on-screen (soundtrack dissonance) its purpose remains the same, to rouse emotion. An iconic example of soundtrack dissonance occurs in the film Metropolis. The musical accompaniment to the destruction of the city in the final scene, is the sweet and gentle I Can’t Stop Loving You by Ray Charles.

It is also possible to **blur the boundaries** between diegetic and non-diegetic sound on-screen, to add interest to a narrative and heighten the viewer’s experience. In the film Blazing Saddles, directed by Mel Brooks, a lonely cowboy rides through the desert accompanied by non-diegetic orchestral music. Or so we are led to believe, until he stumbles upon a full-size orchestra performing in the sand and blazing sun. Here the viewer realises they have been played with. It was diegetic music all along, which creates a moment of comedy gold.

In an on-screen sequence where the source of the music/sound changes from diegetic to non-diegetic, or from non-diegetic to diegetic, we can describe the music/sound as **trans-diegetic**. Often trans-diegetic sound is used to help ‘bridge or link two things, like transitions between scenes’ (Masterclass, 2021), which is the case in the following example.

#Exploring diegetic, non-diegetic and trans-diegetic sound in XR
**Extended reality** (XR)’is an umbrella term that covers all of the various technologies that enhance our senses’ (Nancy Gupton, 2017) and it comes in different forms including Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. **Augmented Reality** (AR) takes place inthe real and physical world but has an added sensory layer or layers. **Virtual Reality** (VR) by contrast, takes place in an *entirely* virtual world, which fully immerses participants into the experience, mentally and emotionally taking them away from real life.

Example 1 | Knightfall:

Knightfall is an AR game for iOS and Android, typically played on mobile phones. Gamers point their phone camera at a flat surface such as a table, for the game landscape to then appear on that table, within their home.

*Bobric, 2018*
*Knighfall played on a table in the player’s living room*

Within the game there are a mixture of diegetic and non-diegetic sounds. **Diegetic** sounds include characters voices, shooting sounds, and horse’s hooves. **Non-diegetic** sounds include music to enhance the mood of the game. Then there are sounds that are difficult to classify, such as the sound the player hears when they step outside the game action for a moment to view a dashboard. The characters within the game would not be able to hear this sound, so we could say it is non-diegetic. However, the player is still immersed in a world that is *not* his physical reality, not his lounge with his family around him, which means we could argue this is still diegetic sound.

*Bobric, 2018*
*Viewing the dashboard triggers non-diegetic sound*

In gaming it can often be a challenge to classify sounds, and this is due to the fact there are different degrees to which the player is immersed in the game world. Moments of pure action, like battling another character, are maximum immersion. Dashboards, scoreboards, and pop-up hints and tricks are one step removed. They take the player out of the action momentarily, and yet they still exist within the game world strictly speaking. Perhaps then, it is more accurate to describe the sounds accompanying dashboards, scoreboards and such like as **trans-diegetic**, because they create a link between the layer of the game characterised action, and the layer one step out from that i.e. the stats and commentary accompanying the action.

Example 2 | Rapid Fire:

Rapid Fire is an educational/entertainment VR experience, played on the Oculus Rift VR platform. Players wear a headset and enter ‘a brief history of flight’, from the Wright Flyer’s first leap through to WW1 fighter planes and beyond. When they move their head they are able to explore the landscape within the experience in real-time and interact with different aeroplanes, effectively becoming the main character within this virtual reality world. In this character’s shoes, the **diegetic** sounds within the virtual world include jet engine noises and explosions.

*Inception VR, 2017*
*A moment from the Rapid Fire VR experience*

There is also a narrator, prompting you to look in particular directions at particular times, so as not to miss vital moments of action. In the article ‘The Gap is Gone: Sound in the New VR Frontier’ the author states that ‘sound is far more important in VR than it ever was in film or tv’. In addition to immersing people in the experience and conveying emotion, sound is important “to lead the user’s attention towards something you want them to see that may be out of view”.

To classify the voice of the narrator we need to remember that the player *is in fact the character* within the virtual world. As this character can hear the narrator, we could describe the narrator’s voice as a diegetic sound. However this classification is not wholly satisfying, because we do not ever actually see the narrator within the experience. His presence is voice-only and so he exists at one step removed from the main action. In this sense his voice is a non-diegetic sound, or something in-between.

# Conclusion
From my research I have discovered that the terms diegetic and non-diegetic, as they are traditionally used to describe sound in film, do not wholly translate to the world of XR — as demonstrated in the examples above.

I have also realised that, while non-diegetic sounds in film create a buffer or safety barrier between the audience and the action, the whole purpose of VR is to fully immerse the player in the action. Anything that breaks the illusion of the experience, anything that reveals it is *not in fact* reality, is undesirable.

In the article ‘Diegetic and Non-diegetic Health Interfaces in VR Shooter Games’ (2021) Köhle K, Hoppe M, Schmidt A and Mäkelä V discuss how the health bar in a VR game hinders the experience, because the player observes it non-diegetically in the corner of the screen. Sometimes the health bar even gets in the way of the player seeing the action: ‘The viewpoint changes based on the player’s head movement [therefore] non-diegetic UI elements may not be ideal’ (Kohle et al 2021). A number of variations to the health bar were trialled to try to improve the experience including the player’s health being shown on a wristwatch, and the player’s vision shuddering to show his health was declining. There were pros and cons to each of the variations, but what struck me reading this article was how all the potential solutions focussed on the visual aspect alone. I challenged myself to think of ways that sound could solve the problem and was able to imagine a number of possibilities.

One idea I had was that a wounded character could make a noise when their health drops below a certain point (diegetic sound), then from that moment onwards that same sound could be echoed and artistically woven into the accompanying music (becoming non-diegetic). This way the accompanying music would serve as a reminder that the player’s health is in jeopardy, until the character’s health is restored and the health warning audio ‘motif’ can disappear from the music. Another solution could be to suppress diegetic sounds from the environment, while amplifying diegetic sounds that indicate low health, like the character’s laboured breathing.

The potential for sound and music to optimise XR is incredible. As the space evolves and matures I expect new terminology will be created too, to better capture the ways that sound can be used to enhance the experience for the user.
